        <h3>
           She was an American abolitionist and
           social activist who rescued approximately 70
           enslaved people, including her family and friends,
           using a network of antislavery activists and safe houses
           known collectively as the Underground Railroad.
           In addition to freeing slaves, Tubman was also a Civil War spy, nurse and supporter of women's suffrage.
